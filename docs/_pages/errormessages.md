## Introduction

Did EqualsVerifier give an error message that you didn't understand? I try to make the error messages as clear as possible, but unfortunately Java's stacktraces leave little room for explanation sometimes. This page should help make sense of some of EqualsVerifier's error messages.

Before you continue, please check your class's `toString` method. Since EqualsVerifier relies on `toString` when generating error messages, overriding it helps with getting better error messages. I recommend including the name of the class, and a summary of all the fields relevant to the equals contract. For example:

{% highlight java %}
@Override public String toString() {
    return getClass().getSimpleName() + ": x=" + x + ", y=" + y;
}
// "Point: x=1, y=2"
{% endhighlight %}

## The error messages
This is not a complete list. I'll add to it as needed, so if you need help with an error message, please [file an issue](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues) or let me know on the [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/equalsverifier), and I'll add an explanation as soon as possible.
